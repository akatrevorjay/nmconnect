I wrote a wrapper script around nmcli because I found it horrible to use to actually connect to anything with.
It allows you to quickly search for and connect to a NetworkManager profile from the CLI without worrying about UUIDs or other assorted carp.

It's a huge time saver for me, and you don't have to be in X to use it.
You'll need Bash 4.0 or higher.

I must thank the ABS guide that I always find to be a tremendously useful reference while writing in bash: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html

Installation:

1. Copy nmconnect and symlinks somewhere in your PATH.
	$ cd "$HOME/.bin"
	$ cp -av /path/to/this/folder/{nmconnect,vpn,lan,wlan} ./

What the commands do:
	nmconnect	- works on the full connection list
	vpn		- automatically adds type=vpn to the search, so "vpn AwesomeCo" is the same as running "nmconnect type=vpn AwesomeCo"
	lan/wlan	- same ideology as vpn
 
Examples:

## List all connections
	$ nmconnect
	[*]
	0. "Auto eth0" (type="802-3-ethernet", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
	1. "Auto ILoveSSIDBeacons" (type="802-11-wireless", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
	3. "AwesomeCo" (type="vpn", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
 
## Search all connections for "auto" (search params are case insensitive)
	$ nmconnect auto
	[search=auto]
	0. "Auto eth0" (type="802-3-ethernet", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
	1. "Auto ILoveSSIDBeacons" (type="802-11-wireless", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
 
## The vpn/lan/wlan commands are merely shortcuts, as is shown by the search params (the first line it prints; in the [brackets])
## "vpn AwesomeCo" and "nmconnect type=vpn awesomeco" are synonymous.
	$ vpn
	[type=vpn] ## <-- SEARCH PARAMS
	3. "AwesomeCo" (type="vpn", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
 
	$ nmconnect type=vpn
	[type=vpn]
	3. "AwesomeCo" (type="vpn", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
 
## If you narrow it down to a single result, it asks you if you wish to connect to it.
## The default, as shown by the capital Y, is to connect, so just hit enter and it will connect you.
## If you don't wish to connect, either ctrl+c or type n<enter> and it won't.
	$ vpn awesome
	[type=vpn search=awesome]
	3. "AwesomeCo" (type="vpn", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
	--> Start connection to: "AwesomeCo"? [Y/n]

### Another example by narrowing down to the connection number
	$ vpn 3
	[type=vpn search=3]
	3. "AWESOMEco" (type="vpn", uuid="guid-guid-guid-guid-guid")
	--> Start connection to: "AwesomeCo"? [Y/n]
